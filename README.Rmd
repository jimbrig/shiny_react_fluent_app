# Shiny React Fluent App

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle:Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-green.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

An experimental shiny application using the [shiny.react](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.react) and [shiny.fluent](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.fluent) R packages provided by [Appsilon](https://appsilon.com/).


## About

Alternative to the typical [shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) or [shinydashboard](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard) user interfaces which use a combination of [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) UI HTML templates, this app is designed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) components and Microsoft's [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls) framework.

### User Interface

Use `fluentPage` to create the UI, as it will add proper CSS classes and suppress Bootstrap (you should not use both Bootstrap and Fluent UI at the same time).
